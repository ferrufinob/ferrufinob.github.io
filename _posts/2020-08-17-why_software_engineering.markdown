I spent years trying to figure out what to do with my life, career wise, changed my major 4 times but I was still not happy so I dropped out. I spent years just working as a waitress but I didn’t feel fulfilled, it wasn’t challenging me or helping me grow. I have friends who are software engineers and suggested I give it a try, but I felt like I wasn’t “smart enough” to be one. I decided to give it a chance and took some courses on Udemy and completed some lessons on freecodecamp. I finally felt challenged, I loved what I was able to create with code, and wanted to expand my knowledge even more by applying to Flatiron School. I also like how welcoming the coding community is, any time I feel stuck I there are many who are more than happy to help me. My favorite thing about coding is that it is always evolving so I am never done learning.
